                     I am interested in learning how mechanical and modern technologies work since young age. As I was growing up the challenges shifted slowly towards software systems. First I was playing on my friend's systems and getting to know Amiga 500 and Commodore 64 as well as school i386 and i486 machines. The affinity was solidifed when I got my first PC in 1997 as a present from my father. It was a cutting edge workstation based on Pentium MMX running at 200Mhz, 32MB RAM and 2GB Seagate HDD. I learned how to work with Windows 95 by managing to break it beyond repair and reinstall every week, learning to manage my expectations from complex software systems early on.

                     First time I have met Linux systems was in the beginning of 2000s at University of Belgrade - School of Electrical Engineering. I learned quickly about praise GNU/Linux has gotten as an operating system of choice for demanding applications, and hands on seen how horrible GUI was for daily use on desktop systems. Horrible font rendering and browsing experience didn't stop me for experimenting on my own and continue learing the strength of "do one thing and do it well" principle of Linux.

                     During my almost two decades long career in IT I was working mostly as systems, IP telephony and network engineer. In past couple of years I have shifted towards DevOps and some of the technolgoies I am currently involved with are listed in the section below.
